# Attention, Digital Behavior, and Academic Outcomes Among METU Students

A comprehensive statistical research project investigating the intricate relationships between digital habits, sustained attention, and academic performance among university students.

## Project Overview
Developed as the final project for the **STAT 365 - Sampling and Survey Techniques** course at **Middle East Technical University (METU)**, this study explores how digital behaviors—specifically smartphone usage, social media engagement, and multitasking—correlate with students' focus abilities and academic success (CGPA).

## Survey Methodology & Sampling
This project demonstrates a full-cycle survey implementation, from design to statistical inference:
* **Sample Design:** Implemented a structured sampling strategy to ensure a representative cross-section of the METU student population.
* **Data Collection:** Designed and administered a multi-dimensional academic survey focusing on:
    * Digital lifestyle metrics (e.g., screen time, notification frequency).
    * Self-reported attention spans and frequency of focus-related errors.
    * Academic performance data (CGPA).
* **Methodological Rigor:** Applied data validation and reliability checks to minimize response biases.

## Key Research Findings & Analysis
The research utilized various statistical tests and descriptive analytics to uncover critical insights:
* **The Multitasking Paradox:** Identified a significant correlation between high digital multitasking scores and a higher frequency of "attention-related mistakes" during academic tasks.
* **Digital Distractions:** Analysis of how notification-driven interruptions impact sustained attention (vigilance), drawing on classical psychological frameworks like the Mackworth Clock Test.
* **Academic Correlation:** Evaluated the impact of smartphone addiction levels on overall CGPA, providing a data-driven look at digital distractions in a university setting.
* **Focus Resilience:** Investigated how individual differences in study strategies may moderate the relationship between digital habits and focus outcomes.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Statistical Analysis:** Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing.
* **Survey Design:** Questionnaire development, scaling, and sampling frame definition.
* **Tools:** Data processing and visualization using R .
